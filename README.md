# bcs-02-portfolio

## Description

I coded this website to demonstrate a porfolio of my work (and future work) on a website built from scratch.

I learned about the importance of flexboxes and how intricate it can be when styling a page through CSS. I learned how to read DevTools better when deciphering code from other websites as well as my own.
